    To analyze variations in echo chambers, we will be studying how likely 
    users are to participate in and consume either factual, politically 
    misinformative, or mythological information. Observing the tendencies 
    of any one subreddit’s user base will shed light on its users’ general 
    consumption patterns. Aggregated usernames and their associated 
    subreddits, therefore, will provide the basis for this analysis.

    One metric that we used to try and detect echo chambers within Reddit 
    were to look at the user polarity, which is essentially how often a user
    interacts outside of the subreddit that they usually post in. As mentioned before, 
    we had defined three umbrella categories that we wanted to look at: politically
    misinformation, urban myth misinformation, and scientific information. 
    User polarity would then define how often a user interacts with the other two 
    subreddit categories.
