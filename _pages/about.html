    <p>
        For our analysis on looking at misinformation on Reddit, we thought it would be interesting
        to analyze the differences and/or similarities of two kinds of misinformation, while having 
        the baseline diffusion of scientific information. To do this, we had set up three main 
        categories of (mis)information we wanted to look at: myth (urban legend) misinformation, 
        political misinformation, and scientific information. Below, you can find the list of 
        the subreddits we looked at for each category. We gathered comments from posts within these 
        subreddits during the months between March 2020 - June 2020.
